When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    I would use a remote repository rather than a local one if I was going to be doing my work on multiple computers, or I was working on a project with multiple people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    One might always want to pull changes manually because then things they may have been working on could be changed, causing problems with the file.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are clones of a repository that are cloned directly to GitHub. A clone is a copy of a repository that can be cloned to github or locally. A branch is made of commits that are not connected to the master branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally is beneficial because it allows for local users to pull all recent remote commits to the local computer to use when ready. In this case, if not near an internet connection, you can still see what has been recently changed by collaborators.
