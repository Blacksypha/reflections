What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	When a repository is initialized, a snapshot is taken of all the files in the directory. It must be done, because until a repository is initialized, the history of the files is not tracked, and commits cannot be made.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
	
	The staging area is the middle phase between the working directory and a respository. Before a repository is created, files are chosen from the working directory, and placed in the staging area to be sent together as one commit. This is valuable, because it allows a person to pick and choose from the directory, what they want committed.
